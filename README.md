# Process-Manager
Created a C library called `libssp` that functions as a subreaper, capable of creating, managing, and monitoring processes similar to Pythonâ€™s subprocess module. The `ssp` library will manage process lifecycles, handle file descriptors, and adopt orphan processes using subreaper functionality. This requires implementing system calls and proper error handling.
